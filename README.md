# R Projects Portfolio

## About this Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase my data analysis and data science skills using R. It includes a collection of projects that demonstrate my ability to handle end-to-end analytical procedures, from data cleaning and exploration to statistical modeling and predictive simulations.

I'm currently in the process of adding more projects, but feel free to explore the work here.

## Proyects

### 1. Predicting Customer Detractors (Part 1): Analyzing Contextual Factors via Logistic Regression
* **Problem:** This case study aims to identify key factors that influence customer's likelihood to recommend the company after interacting with customer service. 
* **Methodology:** The project utilizes a comprehensive analytical approach, including:
  * **Data Simulation & Cleaning:** Creating and preparing the dataset for analysis.
  * **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using data visualization (e.g., heatmaps) and descriptive statistics to uncover patterns across multiple and interactive factors.
  * **Statistical Modeling:** Evaluating different regression models (linear, ordinal, binomial) to predict customer's likelihood to recommend the company. 
  * **Simulation Based Recommendations:** Predictions to evaluate the impact of different actions. 
  * **Reusable Functions:** The creation of functions to automate procedures.
* **Tools & Libraries**: R with a focus on libraries such as car, VGAM, ordinal, psych, vcd, coefplot, ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, openxlsx, and readxl.
